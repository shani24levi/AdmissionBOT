## Not Handeled Cases (TO Do):
The bot does not handle the following cases:

- Validation tests for login to linkedin or oulook, it is assumed that a user is automatically registered by Chrome.
- Verifying the data extraction case
- Page loading time, the assumption is that an operation is step by step and includes uploading the relevant page between a transaction from one page to another
